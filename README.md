# Expense-Tracker
Account Based Expense Tracker

This Expense tracker allows the user to create an account. They are then directed to the home page where they can add their income and their expenses and view a Sankey and Pie chart with both. This allows for visualization of where the income is going and what expenses are highest. This project is a work in progress, and more features and optimizations are to be added. It is coded using React.js, Node.js, andd MongoDB to store user data. Graphs were made using Google's Chart library.
